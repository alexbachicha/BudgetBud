## Description

BudgetBud is an application that allows a user to track their expenses. Being able to access this information, anytime and anywhere, is paramount when on the go, and especially during work-related travel. BudgetBud allows a user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. This is key for users who can't always access their banking information due to lack of a wireless connection.
