# Unit 19 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

## Description

BudgetBud is an application that allows a user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online. This is key for users who like to travel between, during or in the middle of business, whether personal or work-related, and can't always access their banking information due to lack of a wireless connection.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.
